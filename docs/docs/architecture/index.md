# Architecture Overview

> **Purpose:**
> *This document outlines the architecture of the system, describing its components, interactions, and design choices. The architecture aims to deliver a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution for managing property leasing and market survey data.*

## High-Level Architecture

The system architecture is designed to support the following key components:

- **DataHub Web Application**: A web-based application that provides a user interface for managing property leasing and market survey data.
- **Backend Services**: Services responsible for data processing, storage, and retrieval.
- **Database**: A relational database to store property leasing and market survey data.
- **Integration Services**: Services that integrate with external systems and data sources.

The high-level architecture diagram below illustrates the key components and their interactions:
