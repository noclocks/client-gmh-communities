## Overview

This proposal outlines the collaboration between No Clocks, LLC (Service Provider) and GMH (Client) to design, develop, and deploy a dashboard with user authentication and management, as well as integrate the `Entrata` API with a custom designed database backend to enhance leasing data visualization and management capabilities. The project aims to deliver a functional MVP enabling GMH to visualize and export leasing data effectively & securely.

## Scope of Work

The project's scope is broken out into the following sections:

1. **Dashboard Creation with User Authentication & Management**:

- Design and implement a user-friendly dashboard interface.
- Develop robust user authentication and management features.
- Include data visualization, export capabilities, and any additional features as per GMH requirements & requests.

2. **API Integration with Database Architecture**:

- Integrate provided `Entrata` API endpoints for real-time data access and updates.
- Design & integrate backend database schema for secure data storage in cloud services.
- Ensure seamless data flow between the `Entrata` API and the dashboard.

## Objectives and Deliverables

- **Dashboard**: A functional and secure dashboard with user authentication and management capabilities.
- **Database Architecture**: A robust database architecture for secure data storage and retrieval.
- **API Integration**: Seamless integration of the necessary APIs with the dashboard.

### Dashboard Creation with User Authentication & Management

Successfully create a dashboard that includes user authentication and management functionalities:

- Design and develop a dashboard interface with features tailored to GMH's requirements.
- Develop user management features, including role-based access control.
- Implement data visualization and export capabilities for leasing data.

### Database Architecture

Design and implement a secure database architecture for storing and managing leasing data:

- Design a database architecture for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Implement robust data security measures to protect sensitive information.

### API Integration with Dashboard

Integrate API with the dashboard to ensure real-time data updates and seamless operation:

- Integrate with provided `Entrata` API upon receiving access approval.
- Implement robust data handling and integration techniques.

## Timeline and Milestones

_This project aims to provide the MVP and other necessary deliverables in ~1 week's worth of work._

- **Day 1-2:**
  - Initial UI/UX Design for Dashboard
  - Development of User Authentication and Management Features
- **Day 3-4:**
  - Database Architecture Design and Implementation
  - API Integration
- **Day 5:**
  - Testing and Quality Assurance
  - Deployment and Initial Feedback Collection
- **Day 6-7:**
  - Review and Iteration based on Feedback
  - Final MVP Deployment

## Budget and Invoicing

- Billing rate is $50 per hour (per developer).
- The estimated cost for the MVP is approximately $2,000 (subject to change based on project scope adjustments).
- Invoices issued upon completion of each milestone, detailing man-hours and resources used.

## Risk and Mitigation Strategies

- **API Access Delays**: The project timeline accounts for potential delays in receiving API access. Continuous communication with the API provider will mitigate prolonged delays.
- **Technical Challenges**: Conduct a preliminary technical review to anticipate issues and allocate resources accordingly.
- **Scope Creep**: Implement a strict change request process, requiring client sign-off for any deviations from the project scope.

## Communication Plan

- **Regular Updates:** Daily status updates and progress reports via email and project management tools.
- **Urgent Communications:** Dedicated lines for urgent communications to ensure prompt response and resolution of critical issues.
